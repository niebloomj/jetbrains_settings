Sample output files are found in the tests/correct/ folder and should all follow one of the following formats:

If a graph is colored correctly, the format is:

YES
Number of colors used in the graph


If a graph is NOT colored correctly, the format is:

NO
Number of edges whose vertices are colored the same color
For each edge of this type (sorted by edge ID number):
the edge ID number
the edge name
the name of the first vertex
the name of the second vertex
the color common to both vertices




NOTE: Each output file should end with a newline.
