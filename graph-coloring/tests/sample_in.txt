Sample input files are found in the tests/in/ folder and should all follow this format:

Number of vertices on the first line
Number of edges on the second line
For every vertex:
the vertex ID number
the vertex name
the vertex color
For every edge:
the edge ID number (may be the same as a vertex ID number)
the edge name
the first vertex on the edge
the second vertex on the edge

NOTE: Each input file should end with a newline.
